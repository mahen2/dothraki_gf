Dothraki Nouns : text2mindmap.com/B7b25jR *updated*

TO DO

* add new grammar
  some ideas:
  * zero copula sentences ("the queen is a warrior" -- "khaleesi lajak") [fairly easy]
  * expletive constructions ("there is ..." -- " ... vekha") [fairly easy]
  * demonstrative pronouns (this/that -- jin/haz/rek) [medium]
  * personal pronouns (I/you/he/we/they/it -- anha/yer/me/kisha/yeri/mori) [somewhat difficult?]
  * relative clauses [difficult?]
  * adjectives [medium/difficult?]
  * prepositions [medium/difficult?]
  * auxiliaries [difficult?]
  
* more test cases for epenthesis
* transitive verbs should assign case to their object(s)


DONE

* fix bug regarding noun declination (selection of animate nouns depending on vowels)
* complete noun declination
* vary verbs (currently only stab_v2 is being used)
* verb declination for both stem-options
* update English version
* negative verbs/sentences
* tenses
