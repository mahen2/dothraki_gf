  * demonstrative pronouns (this/that -- jin/haz/rek) [medium]
  * personal pronouns (I/you/he/we/they/it -- anha/yer/me/kisha/yeri/mori) [somewhat difficult?]
  * adjectives [medium/difficult?] -> Maria 

  * relative clauses [difficult?]
  * prepositions [medium/difficult?]
  * auxiliaries [difficult?]
  * ray (already) for perfect tense
  
* more test cases for epenthesis
